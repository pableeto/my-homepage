I am currently a researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. 
Previously I was a graphics algorithm engineer in the Graphics AI team at Kuaishou Technology (Kwai Inc.).
I got my Ph.D. degree from the joint Ph.D. program between Unitersity of Science and Technology of China and Microsoft Research Asia in 2019, under the supervision of Dr. Baining Guo and Dr. Yong Wang.
From 2014 to 2019, I was a long-term research intern in Internet Graphics group at Microsoft Research Asia.
I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Eletronic Engineering also from Unitersity of Science and Technology of China in 2013.

Currently my research interests fall in the cross-field of computer graphics and computer vision.
Specifically, I am interested in appearance modeling / differentiable rendering, 3D shape synthesis and generation.
