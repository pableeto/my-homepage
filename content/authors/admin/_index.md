I am currently a senior researcher in <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/media-computing-group>Media Computing group</a> at <a href="https://www.msra.cn/">Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)</a>. 
Prior to joining MSRA, I was a researcher / alogrithm engineer in <a href="http://www.chongyangma.com/team/index.html">Graphics AI team</a> at <a href="https://www.kuaishou.com/">Kuaishou Technology (Kwai Inc.)</a>.

I got my Ph.D. degree from the joint Ph.D. program between <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/">Unitersity of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> and MSRA in 2019, under the supervision of Dr. Baining Guo and Dr. Yong Wang. I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Eletronic Engineering also from USTC in 2013.

From 2014 to 2019, I was a long-term research intern in <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/internet-graphics>Internet Graphics group</a> at MSRA, where I conducted my Ph.D. research with thesis topic on appearance and geometry modeling with deep learning approach.

Currently my research interests fall in computer graphics and computer vision.
Specifically, I am interested in 3D synthesis and generation, neural rendering, and multi-modality.
